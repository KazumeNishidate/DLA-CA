# DLA-CA

This code intricately simulates the diffusion-limited aggregation
Cellular Automata, a complex system based on the RWCA model [1,2,3].
                                                                               - Each walker embarks on a fascinating journey of random steps across
  the 2D lattice, guided by the RWCA rule. Meanwhile, a seed walker
  remains at the center site, a steadfast point in the ever-changing
  landscape.

- When a walker comes into contact with the seed walker, it also
  becomes a part of the seed walker and does not move anymore.
